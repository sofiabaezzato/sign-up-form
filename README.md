# Sign-up Form

This project implements a sign-up form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form allows users to input their information, including name, email, phone,password, and password confirmation. The JavaScript `check()` function validates the `confirm-password` input while the user is typing.

## Project Reflections

1. I've learned how to manage various form inputs, including their attributes such as `autocomplete` and `required`.
2. I've successfully applied custom styles to `:invalid` fields in Chrome not on page load but only after user input. I'm still exploring ways to achieve the same in the Opera browser. However, considering Opera's small market share, I don't consider it a major issue.
3. I've invested significant effort into creating a responsive page using only flexbox, minimizing the need for media queries.
